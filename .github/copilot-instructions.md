You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

## Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection

## graphify

For any question about this repo's architecture, structure, components, or how to add/modify/find
code, your first action should be `graphify query "<question>"` when `graphify-out/graph.json`
exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationship questions and `graphify explain "<concept>"`
for focused-concept questions. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than the full
report or raw grep output.

Triggers: "how do I…", "where is…", "what does … do", "add/modify a <component>",
"explain the architecture", or anything that depends on how files or classes relate.

If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, use it for broad navigation. Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context. Only read
source files when (a) modifying/debugging specific code, (b) the graph lacks the needed detail, or
(c) the graph is missing or stale.

Type `/graphify` in Copilot Chat to build or update the graph.
